      Python is a programming language invented in 1991. It was named after the TV show "Monty Python"
      <br>
      <br>
      Python is interpreted. That means that instead of looking at the code and making code in a different programming language which the user has to run again, it looks at the code and runs code in a different programming language directly.
      <br>
      <span class='extraInfo'>Python is built on top of the programming language C. The official implementation of Python is called "CPython". An implementation of a programming language is an "interpreter" or something else called a "compiler" written in a specific language.</span>
